# PNV3321-Optimization-Methods-Applied-to-Engineering-Systems
An excel file developed for my university course that covers linear modeling, linear programming, and some non-linear programming topics too. This is not meant 
to be efficient but rather show the step by step of some solution methods like the simplex and two-phase method. On top of that note that it is an unfinished
project, but might prove to be useful or be a good starting point for something else.
